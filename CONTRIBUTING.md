# Contributing
What's New uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to build and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

## Setup
Clone the project, then run `npm i`.

* `npm run build` will build the project
* `npm run dev` will build & watch for changes
* `npm run test` to run tests, `npm run test:watch` to watch for changes.
* `npm run lint` to lint

All new functionality should have passing tests & should pass our eslint checks. Any changes to `package-lock.json` must be committed.
